# Allertgen

### How we built it
After having planned out the design flow, we sketched out our designs using Figma to build the UI using HTML/CSS. The majority of the back-end of our program was built using Python, which facilitated the use of Google Cloud for image classification (including building and training a machine learning model using Google Cloud's AutoML), and text detection/translation with Google Cloud's Vision API and Google Cloud's Translation API. We also used Google Cloud's App Engine with Flask in order to integrate the Python back-end with the HTML/CSS front-end.
